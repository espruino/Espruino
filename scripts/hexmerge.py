"""Merge content of several hex files into one file."""

VERSION = '2.0'

USAGE = '''hexmerge: merge content of hex files.
Usage:
    python hexmerge.py [options] FILES...

Options:
    -h, --help              this help message.
    -v, --version           version info.
    -o, --output=FILENAME   output file name (emit output to stdout
                            if option is not specified)
    -r, --range=START:END   specify address range for output
                            (ascii hex value). Both values are inclusive.
                            Range can be in form 'START:' or ':END'.
    --no-start-addr         Don't write start addr to output file.
    --overlap=METHOD        What to do when data in files overlapped.
                            Supported variants:
                            * error -- stop and show error message (default)
                            * ignore -- keep data from first file that
                                        contains data at overlapped address
                            * replace -- use data from last file that
                                         contains data at overlapped address

Arguments:
    FILES       list of hex files for merging
                (use '-' to read content from stdin)

You can specify address range for each file in the form:

    filename:START:END

See description of range option above.

You can omit START or END, so supported variants are:

    filename:START:     read filename and use data starting from START addr
    filename::END       read filename and use data till END addr

Use entire file content:

    filename
or
    filename::
