Build Commands
--------------

Building for an Espruino board is generally done by typing:

```
BOARD=BOARDNAME make
```

And for release, by typing:

```
RELEASE=1 BOARD=BOARDNAME make
```

Valid board names are in comments at the head of the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/espruino/Espruino/blob/master/Makefile)..

Release builds have all the assertions removed, reducing flash usage. Normal builds still have the assertions, and debug builds (with `DEBUG=1` have more debug info in the assertions, as well as the debug info needed for proper GDB debugging).

The Make system has the following targets:

* `clean` - Clean the build
* `all` (or unspecified) - Build, including binaries needed for flashing the firmware
* `flash` - Generate the firmware files and flash to the board
* `serialflash` - Generate the firmware files and flash to the board via serial bootloader (used for STM32, especially the Original Espruino and Espruino Pico)

Build Process
-------------

* Overall build logic is in the [`Makefile`](https://github.com/espruino/Espruino/blob/master/Makefile).
* The  [Board Definition File](#boarddefinition) in `boards/$BOARD.py` is parsed by [`scripts/get_makefile_decls.py`](scripts/get_makefile_decls.py) to work out extra definitions for the Makefile (chip family, part number, binary name, whether it has a bootloader), which control the build.
* Architecture-specic build logic is in the [`make`](https://github.com/espruino/Espruino/tree/master/make) directory - this is called based off `family` in the [Board Definition File](#boarddefinition) in `boards/`.
* The `Makefile` adds source files to `$SOURCES`, and 'wrapper' source files to `$WRAPPERSOURCES`. [Wrapper files](#wrapperfiles) are files that contain functions that are exposed to JS.
* The script [`scripts/build_platform_config.py`](scripts/build_platform_config.py) is run which generates `gen/platform_config.h` from `boards/$BOARD.py` - this contains information like the amount of RAM, as well as buffer sizes and the amount of variables that will be stored.
* The script [`scripts/build_pininfo.py`](scripts/build_pininfo.py) creates [the pin definitions](#pindefinitions) and puts them in `gen/jspininfo.c`
* The script [`scripts/build_jswrapper.py`](scripts/build_jswrapper.py) is then run on `$WRAPPERSOURCES` - it generates `gen/jswrapper.c` - a hard-coded symbol table of built-in functions - from the [Wrapper files](#wrapperfiles).
* Source files are built
* On embedded targets, a linker file `gen/linker.ld` is auto-generated by [`scripts/build_linker.py`](scripts/build_linker.py) based on the [board definition](#boarddefinition) (available flash, ram, bootloader etc). In some targets (especially non-STM32) a pre-made linker file will be used instead.
* Everything is linked using link time optimisation (where possible) - this helps to inline code that wouldn't otherwise have been inlined, and generally makes for a much more efficient binary.
* The `elf` file is converted with `objdump` to:
  * `bin` (for uploading to Espruino board)
  * `hex` (for uploading to mbed/etc)
  * `lst` (assembler listing - used for debugging)
* [`scripts/check_size.sh`](scripts/check_size.sh) does a sanity check of the `bin` file's size against what's described in the [board definition](#boarddefinition), and fails if it won't fit into available flash memory.

Oddities
--------

* `malloc` and `free` are not included, because they're not needed and by default they use a large pool of valuable RAM to speed up memory allocation.
* `strcpy`, `memcpy`, `memset` are all reimplemented in [`jsutils.h`](src/jsutils.h) - again because of initial issues with high flash memory usage
* Espruino on STM32 uses its own [Maths library](lib/maths) for double arithmetic, because when building initially the libraries included by GCC dynamically allocated memory - which pulled in `malloc`. If we could move back to GCC libraries at some point it'd be a huge bonus


Board Definition File  <a name="boarddefinition">
-------------------------------------------------

The board definition files are `.py` files that reside in the [`boards`](boards) folder (for example [the Pico one](boards/PICO_R1_3.py)). They're used all over the place:

* To work out the binary's name
* To choose which libraries get built in via the Makefile
* To specify the architecture-specific Makefile fragments are used
* To create `gen/platform_config.h` via [`scripts/build_playform_config.py`](scripts/build_playform_config.py)
* To generate the linker file `gen/linker.ld` using [`scripts/build_linker.py`](scripts/build_linker.py). Mainly STM32-based targets only.
* To create [the pin definitions](#pindefinitions)
* To create the HTML page on each individual board (referenced from [the top of the Reference](http://www.espruino.com/Reference)) using [`scripts/build_board_docs.py`](scripts/build_board_docs.py)
* Converted to JSON (along with the pin declarations) and put [on espruino.com](http://www.espruino.com/json/PICO_R1_3.json) to help with autocomplete in the Web IDE (and auto-population of dropdowns in the Blockly editor). Converted by [`scripts/build_board_json.py`](scripts/build_board_json.py)

These contain:

### info

* Board name and link (for the HTML file)
* Default console device, pins, and baus rate (the device Espruino goes to when USB is unplugged or not built in)
* `variables` - The number of variables to use (this depends on the amount of RAM available). Less than 1023 vars use 12 bytes per var, more uses 16 bytes. You have to adjust this such that there is spare room for the stack and static variables (on Espruino boards this means leaving around 16kB free, but on smaller boards it can be reduced a lot)
* `bootloader` - whether the binary image needs compiling with a special USB-VCP bootloader (Espruino boards only)
* `binary_name` - the name of the binary that'll be produced
* `binaries` - available binaries - this is used by the Web IDE to allow the user to choose which binary to upload
* `build` - controls what gets build via the Makefile:
  * `optimizeflags` - flags like `-O3` to give to the compiler
  * `libraries` - list of libraries to include
  * `makefile` - list of commands/definitions to execute in the Makefile

### chip

* `part` - Chip part number (this is defined in the compiler - eg if the part is `STM32F401CDU6`, `-DSTM32F401CDU6` is put on the GCC command-line)
* `family` - Chip family - also defined, but used in the Makefile to define what gets built
* `package` - Used for ST chips when working out [Pin Definitions](#pindefinitions) to ensure that the right pins are included
* `ram` on chip in KB
* `flash` on chip in KB
* `speed` of chip in MHz
* Number of `usart`s
* Number of `spi`s
* Number of `i2c`s
* Number of `adc`s
* Number of `dac`s
* `saved_code` - how and where to save JS code in the chip's flash memory
  * The `address` of the start of the code in flash memory. Note that on STM32 chips this
    is at 0x08000000 even though code executes from 0x00000000 (the two areas are mirrored but
    0x00000000 is faster to execute from while 0x08000000 is what's needed for writing to flash)
  * The `page_size` in bytes of the first flash page containing code (not used now?)
  * The number of flash `pages` we're using for code (not used now?)
  *  `flash_available` in KB, used as a sanity check by [`scripts/check_size.sh`](scripts/check_size.sh) after the build completes
* `place_text_section` what address to start the program code at - This is `0` if not specified,
  but is useful in devices like the Pico where varying page sizes mean that the program code may
  be located after the saved program code (and/or bootloader)

### board

Names of rows of pins - used solely by [`scripts/build_board_docs.py`](scripts/build_board_docs.py) to generate the nice HTML description.

There can also be a `_css` element which contains raw Cascading Style Sheets, which contain carefully tweaked positions of the rows of pins defined in `board`, to align with the background image in [`boards/img`](boards/img)

### devices

This is a list of built-in stuff on the board that is made accessible to Espruino. It's:

* Parsed and turned into a series of `#define`s in `gen/platform_config.h` by [this code](scripts/build_platform_config.py#L298).
* Used for the magenta tags shown near pins in the board's HTML file - that warn users that the pin might be used for some other function.

Stuff you can use is `LED1`-`LED8`, `BTN1`-`BTN4`, `USB`, `LCD` (for boards with FSMC LCDs built in), `SD` (SD card), `JTAG` (when JTAG pins are defined, but we need to make sure we leave them alone when the board resets). You can also define your own.


Pin Definitions <a name="pindefinitions">
---------------

The pin definitions are created by [`scripts/build_pininfo.py`](`scripts/build_pininfo.py`) and are stored in `gen/jspininfo.c`. The script calls
 `get_pins` in `boards/$BOARD.py` and a structure of the following form is returned:

```
[
   { "name":"PD12", "sortingname":"D12", "port":"D", "num":"20", "functions":{}, "csv":{} },
   { "name":"PD13", "sortingname":"D13", "port":"D", "num":"23", "functions":{ "SPI1_SCK":0 }, "csv":{} },
   ...
]
```

`get_pins` can define the raw array (like [boards/MICROBIT.py](boards/MICROBIT.py)), or on boards with STM32 chips like the [Pico](boards/PICO_R1_3.py) some utility functions auto-generate the code from [CSV files](pins) that were copied from ST's datasheets.

* `name` is the pin name - due to random historical reasons (from ST datasheets) it needs prefixing with `P`
* `sortingname` is the name, but padded so that when it's sorted everything appears in the right order
* `port` is the actual port - on ESP8266 this might not be needed and could just default to `D`
* `num` is the pin number - this doesn't have to match `D` - it's what is needed internally to access the hardware. For instance [Olimexino](boards/OLIMEXINO_STM32.py) has 'logical' pins that actually map all over the place.
* `function` is a map of pin functions to their 'alternate functions' (an STM32 chip thing - STM32F4 chips can have different peripherals on each pin, so the alternate function is a number that you shove in that pin's register in order to connect it to that peripheral). The format, for instance `I2C1_SDA` is important as it's parsed later and is used to build `gen/jspininfo.c`. The code to parse them [is here](scripts/pinutils.py#L26)
* `csv` isn't needed, but when using data grabbed from csv files from ST's datasheets [like this](boards/pins/stm32f401.csv) it contains the raw data for debugging)


Wrapper Files <a name="wrapperfiles">
-------------

Wrapper files are normal C source files that contain functions that are exposed to JavaScript code in the interpreter. They're prefixed `jswrap_`.

See [libs/README.md](libs/README.md) for a short tutorial on how to add your wrapper files.

Each function to be exposed has a specially formatted comment above it containing JSON. The format of this JSON is specified in [this file](https://github.com/espruino/Espruino/blob/master/scripts/common.py#L52)

An example of a wrapper file might be:

```
#include "jswrap_hello.h"  // We need the declaration of the jswrap_hello_world function
#include "jsinteractive.h" // Pull in the jsiConsolePrint function

// Let's define the JavaScript class that will contain our `world()` method. We'll call it `Hello`
/*JSON{
  "type" : "class",
  "class" : "Hello"
}
Some info about this class
*/

// Now, we define the `jswrap_hello_world` to be a `staticmethod` on the `Hello` class
/*JSON{
  "type" : "staticmethod",
  "class" : "Hello",
  "name" : "world",
  "generate" : "jswrap_hello_world"
}
We can write simple markdown-formatted comments in here. These
then get scanned and turned into the Espruino [Reference](http://www.espruino.com/Reference)

 * Bulletted
 * List
*/
void jswrap_hello_world() {
    jsiConsolePrint("Hello World!\r\n");
}
```

In the build process, [`scripts/build_jswrapper.py`](scripts/build_jswrapper.py) parses all these files, pulls out the headers, and generates `gen/jswrapper.c` - a hard-coded symbol table that resides on flash memory. It's consulted whenever

[`scripts/build_jswrapper.py`](scripts/build_jswrapper.py) also needs to be aware of what definitions were passed to the compiler - for instance if `SAVE_ON_FLASH` is defined, several non-vital functions will not be compiled in (so should not appear in the symbol table).

The wrapper files are also parsed by:

* [`scripts/build_docs.py`](scripts/build_docs.py), which builds the HTML file used for the Espruino [Reference](http://www.espruino.com/Reference).
* [`scripts/build_tern_json.js`](scripts/build_tern_json.js), which generates a JSON description of all functions (along with their documentation) which is used for code completion in the Web IDE *and to parse all code examples in order to produce the 'Examples' links in the [Reference](http://www.espruino.com/Reference)*.
