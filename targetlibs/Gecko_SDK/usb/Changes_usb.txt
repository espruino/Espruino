3.20.2:
 - Increased robustness when plug/unplug-ing the USB cable rapidly.
 - Changed implementation of usb string macro, wchar_t is no longer used.
   GCC commandline options -fwide-exec-charset=UTF-16LE, -fshort-wchar and
   -Wl,--no-wchar-size-warning are no longer needed.
   Old version was used like this:
     STATIC_CONST_STRING_DESC( iManufacturer, L"Energy Micro AS" );
   New version is used like this:
     STATIC_CONST_STRING_DESC( iManufacturer, 'E','n','e','r','g','y',' ', \
                                              'M','i','c','r','o',' ','A','S' );

3.20.0:
 - Documentation changes only.

3.0.3:
 - Fixed compile time error when using USB stack energy saving on devices with
   no endpoints in addition to EP0.
 - Fixed bug when repeatedly unplugging/replugging a device USB cable and using
   energy saving modes.

3.0.2:
 - Bugfix: USBD_Init() may now be called when USB peripheral is in partial
   powerdown mode.
 - New function USBD_EpIsBusy( int epAddr ) added to API.
 - Changed USBD_AbortTransfer() from USBD_AbortTransfer( uint8_t ) to
   USBD_AbortTransfer( int ).
 - Added configuration of which hw TIMER the stack will use.

3.0.1:
 - USBD_Stop() now disables all USB related interrupts correctly.
 - Minor documentation changes.
 - Added more flexibility for taking advantage of energymodes in USB applications.
 - Fixed bug in device stack partial powerdown procedure.

3.0.0:
 - Updated to CMSIS_V3, "efm32lib" is now called "emlib"
 - This library has been renamed from "efm32usb" to "usb"
 - Prefixes changed from efm32_ to em_, to reflect changes in emlib
