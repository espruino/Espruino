The Blinky Example shows how to configure the GPIO pins as outputs. These 
outputs can then be used to drive LEDs, as in this example.

When the application starts, some GPIO pins are configured as outputs to drive 
the LEDs. The application then loops while toggling the state of one of the LEDs
every 500 milliseconds.

Testing:
Test the Blinky Example application by performing the following steps:

1. Compile and program the application.
2. Observe that the LEDs are blinking.
