        Libraries:
            - Heart Rate Monitor Profile
            - ANT stack configuration
            - ANT channel configuration
            - ANT channel state indicator
            - ANT pulse simulator
         
        Examples:
            - The ANT HRM examples have been refactored.
            - The Bicycle Power examples (ant_bicycle_pwr) support S310.
  
    ANT + BLE (S310):
        The following examples were added:
        - Bluetooth LE and ANT combined heart rate example (ble_ant_app_hrm).
        - Experimental ANT Shared Channels (experimental_ant_shared_channel_master_to_master, 
          experimental_ant_shared_channel_slave).
 
    BLE:
     - Advertising module has a new mode: Low Duty Cycle Directed Advertising.
     - Running Speed and Cadence Client added as experimental.
     - Bluetooth Developer Studio template added as experimental.
     - Heart Rate Sensor example (ble_app_hrs) supports S310.
     - Running Speed and Cadence example (ble_app_rscs) supports S310.
     - Combined Peripheral and Central example added as experimental.
     - DFU Signing using Elliptic Curve Cryptography added as experimental
       (using the same elliptic curve and hashing algorithm as Bluetooth 
       Low Energy 4.2 Secure Connections).
 
Fixed issues:
     - Pstorage now supports updates of bond split across two pages.
     - Advertising module can be set to infinite time-out.
     - Corrected clock source in BLE multiactivity beacon example.
     - Serialization HCI transport layer: Receiving packet-buffer is not 
       freed while sending ACK or NACK.
  
Known issues:
    - Device Manager is not supported in multi-role S130 operation.
        - Device Manager works in peripheral or central only operation on 
          S130. This must be decided at compile time.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum 
      connection interval of 11.25 ms. The application cannot handle 
      connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system 
      reset in the middle of a firmware update.
         Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware 
         update process, consider increasing the connection interval used
         by the master.
    - App_pwm occasionally gives inverted signal.
    - The old manual procedure for testing buttonless DFU, as specified in
      the documentation, can lead to the DFU process hanging or returning 
      an error when used with Master Control Panel 3.8 and newer.

Known issues:
    - Device Manager is not supported in multirole S130 operation.
        - Device Manager works in peripheral or central only operation on S130. This must be decided at compile time.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 
      11.25 ms. The application cannot handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may 
      undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update.
        Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware update process, consider
        increasing the connection interval.

    - ANT:
        - NRFFOSDK-755: HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time.

    - BLE:
        - A few APIs of the Device Manager are not implemented. Also, documentation providing 
          examples of how the API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device Manager (pstorage) does not support update of bond split across two 
          pages.

    - Proprietary:
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box 
          with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
          The legacy examples need to add the following to work with the nRF51 examples:
              hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
              hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
              hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
              hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
          In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy 
          Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and 
          channel tables require adjustment.
            - Timeslot period: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the 
              nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects 
              (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
            - Channel table: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the 
              nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

Changes:
    Toolchain/IDE:
        - The nRF51 SDK now supports the following toolchains in most examples:
            - Keil 5.14 (with packs)
            - Keil 5.14 (without packs)
            - Keil 4.72.10
            - ARM GCC 4.7 2013q1
            - IAR 7.20.2
        - The supported SoftDevices are now included in the SDK and can be flashed directly from
          Keil, as a separate target.

    ANT + BLE (dual stack):
        - Removed support for the S310 SoftDevice for BLE API compatibility reasons. For support, 
          use SDK v7.2.0.

    BLE:

              directed/fast/slow advertising, with and without whitelist.
            - Nordic UART Service (ble_nus), detached from the UART over BLE Example.
            - Added Current Time Service Client (ble_cts_c).
            - Service Changed characteristic has been implemented for DFU, so that the indication is
              sent when transitioning between application and bootloader.
            - Implemented a mechanism for sharing of IRK and LTK from application to bootloader. 
              This allows for whitelist advertising and reconnection in DFU mode using existing 
              keys.
        - Examples:
            - The UART over BLE Example is no longer experimental.
            - Added a Time Profile (ble_app_cts_c) example using the Current Time Service Client
              implementation.

            - RTC (Real time counter)
            - TIMER (Timer/counter)
            - WDT (Watchdog timer)
        - Added modules:

            - rtc (NRF_DRV_RTC)
            - timer (NRF_DRV_TIMER)

Fixed issues:
    - Fixed pstorage issue where different applications could write to the same page.

Known issues:
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 
      11.25 ms. The application cannot handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may 
      undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update.
         Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware update process, consider
         increasing the connection interval used by the master.

      Note 2: Some of the examples using the SoftDevice will not fit on the 128 kB variant of the 
              chip.
      Note 3: Some of the serialization examples are too big to be compiled using the free version 
              of Keil.

    - PCA10031
    - S110 connectivity support for Wavetek WT51822

    For other devices and boards, see the SDK documentation, section "Using the SDK with other 
    boards", or use SDK v6.x.x.

Changes:
    - ANT:
        - ANT-FS client example: Added callback to allow applications to execute custom code while
          waiting for the burst to complete
        - Major rework on ANT DFU example
        - Added new ANT hub-2-hub/shared channel example 
        - Added S310 target support for DTM example
        - BLE DFU is now supported for S310

Fixed issues:
    - ANT:
        - ANT-FS: Fixed bug with transfer sequence number error causing download failures
        - ANT-FS: Fixed bug where upon exhaustion of m_retry, the link time-out has been mistakenly
          disabled by a burst transfer
        - Fixed issue in linker script for S310
        - Fixed memory corruption issue by using dedicated buffers for ANT and BLE stack events 
          respectively on S310
        - Fixed an issue where the ANT OTA Updater application v0.8 would not support hex files 
          with code size larger than 65535 bytes

Known issues:
    - SEGGER J-Link software has some issues with Keil. 
      See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for details.
    - Keil 5.13 may issue a warning about missing packs even when all Nordic Semiconductor packs are
      correctly installed. 
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 
      11.25 ms. The application cannot handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may 
      undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update.
         Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware update process, consider
         increasing the connection interval used by the master.

    - ANT:
        - NRFFOSDK-755: HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time

    - BLE:
        - NRFFOSDK-3135: S120 examples: RAM is limited to 16 kB, because S120 V1.0.1 does not 
          support utilizing the whole flash on the QFACAB chip
        - NRFFOSDK-119: Only the ble_app_proximity_low_power and ble_app_hrs applications are power 
          optimized
        - S120 examples: Flash clear operation may fail when connected. Impact of this in the S120 
          examples is that if the peer loses the bond and a rebonding occurs, flash clear fails and
          a DM_EVT_DEVICE_CONTEXT_STORED event is notified with a failure.
        - A few APIs of the Device Manager are not implemented. Also, documentation providing 
          examples of how the API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device Manager (pstorage) does not support update of bond split across two 
          pages.

    - Proprietary:
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is a hardware-related issue
          described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box 
          with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
          The legacy examples need to add the following to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
          In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy 
          Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and 
          channel tables require adjustment.
            - Timeslot period: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the 
              nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects 
              (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
            - Channel table: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the 
              nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

    - IAR: no support in this release
    - Windows XP SP3 32-bit
    - Windows 7 SP1 64-bit
    - Windows 8.1

Tested with devices:
    - nRF51422 QFACAB
    
    For others devices, use SDK 6.x.x.

Supported SoftDevices:
    - S110 7.1.0
    - S120 1.0.1
    - S130 0.5.0-1.alpha
    - S210 4.0.1
    - S310 2.0.0

Supported boards:
    - PCA10028
    - PCA10031
    - S110 connectivity support for Wavetek WT51822

    For other boards, use SDK V6.x.x.

Changes:
    - Experimental support for over-the-air firmware update using the ANT radio protocol
    - New experimental example ANT relay demo
    - Support for S310 ANT+BLE version 2.0.0
    - Re-introduce Device Firmware Update via UART
    - BLE DFU single bank support for bootloader+softdevice update

Fixed issues:
    - NRFFOSDK-3119 Fixed issue in app_timer where issuing start/stop from interrupt context caused long delays

Known issues:

    - SEGGER J-Link software has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 11.25 ms. The application cannot handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update.
         Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during the firmware update process, consider increasing the connection interval used by the master

    ANT
        - The OTA Updater application v.0.8 does not support hex files with code size larger than 65535 bytes.
        - NRFFOSDK-366: ANT-FS host: download sometimes fails when downloading a large file
        - NRFFOSDK-755: HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time

    BLE
        - NRFFOSDK-3135: S120 examples: RAM is limited to 16 kB, because S120 V1.0.1 does not support utilizing the whole flash on the QFACAB chip
        - NRFFOSDK-119: Only the ble_app_proximity_low_power and ble_app_hrs applications are power optimized
        - S120 examples: Flash clear operation may fail when connected. Impact of this in the S120 examples is that if the peer loses the bond and a rebonding occurs, flash clear fails and a DM_EVT_DEVICE_CONTEXT_STORED event is notified with a failure.
        - A few APIs of the Device Manager are not implemented. Also, documentation providing examples of how the API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device Manager (pstorage) does not support update of bond split across two pages.

    Proprietary:
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is a hardware-related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
            - Timeslot period: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
            - Channel table: Edit the gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

Known issues:
    
    - When flashing from Keil 4, a pop-up might appear stating "Cannot Load Flash Device Description !".
          Solution:
            - Write new flash algorithm settings to the uvopt file. 
                Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
                Select "Options for Target" -> "Utilities".
                Press "Settings" button to see flashing algorithms.
                Verify that "nRF51xxx" is in the list of flashing algorithms, if not add it by pressing the "Add" button.
                Exit and save settings by pressing "OK". This is also important to do if you did find the "nRF51xxx" in the list of flashing algorithms.

    - If you have an existing KEIL project target set to use device variant "nRF51", a pop-up might appear stating that you have to "update your device selection".
        Solution:
            Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
            Select "Options for Target" -> "Device".
            Choose "Nordic nRF51 Series Devices" from the Database list.
            Select the variant of the nRF51 chip that is used for the KEIL project target.
    - When using J-Link software prior to version 4.66, a warning might appear when entering "Options for Target" -> "Debug" -> "Settings". The warning indicates that the device is unknown to the specific version of the J-Link software.
        Solution: Upgrade J-Link software to version 4.66 or later.
    - Segger J-Link software has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines, J-Link CDC installer fails producing an error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
        Solution: Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - NRFFOETT-205 - The nRF51822 installer will not run if no C:\ drive exists
    - NRFFOSDK-236 - When the bundled J-Link OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, the error message "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)" might appear . Ignore it. 
    - NRFFOSDK-362 - Reset button won't work after programming without cycling the target power.
    - NRFFOSDK-363 - Flashing software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode 
        Solution: Wake-up the current application from SYSTEM_OFF before flashing a new application.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 11.25 ms. 
      This application will not be able to handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update. 
      Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during firmware update process, consider increasing the connection interval used by the master.

        - S120 Examples: Flash clear operation may fail when connected. Impact of this in the S120 examples is that if peer loses the bond and a re-bonding occurs, flash clear fails, and DM_EVT_DEVICE_CONTEXT_STORED event is notified with a failure.
        - Device manager has a few APIs unimplemented. Also documentation providing examples of how API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device manager (pstorage) doesn't support update of bond split across two pages.

            - 100% s110 BLE APIs are now serialized
        - S110 support for application concurrent multiprotocol radio access
        - Pstorage module: Added API for doing range updates 
        - Experimental: Device firmware upgrade now supports updating both SoftDevice and bootloader for s110
        
    Proprietary
        - Enhanced ShockBurst: Added nrf_esb_reuse_pid() function to API, giving "reuse payload" functionality.
        - Gazell: Added "suspend" mode enabling sharing of radio and PPI. 
        - Gazell: HW resources are released when Gazell is being disabled or entering suspend mode.
        - Gazell: HW resources are reconfigured when Gazell is being enabled or exiting from suspend mode.
    
Fixed issues:
    
    - NRFFOSDK-2542 - SoftDevice related documentation for S110, S120 and S310 BLE stack is not consistent. When looking up SoftDevice application interface or message sequence charts, it is possible that one is looking at incorrect interface. Recommendation hence is to look at SoftDevice headers to ensure correct appplication interface. This is also applicable for Serialization library references. This will be fixed in next release.
        - SDK documentation has been splitted into 4 seperate documents with a common index page.
    
    ANT
        - None

    ANT + BLE (Dual stack)
        - S310 Heart Rate Relay Example: Bonding does not always function as expected. If bonding is enabled using compiler flag it is recommended to perform service discovery before bonding to minimize chances of unexpected behaviour.    

    BLE
        
    Proprietary
        - Enhanced ShockBurst/Gazell: Received packets in Host/PRX mode with CRC error can no longer return ACK to device.

Known issues:
    
    - When flashing from Keil 4, a pop-up might appear stating "Cannot Load Flash Device Description !".
          Solution:
            - Write new flash algorithm settings to the uvopt file. 
                Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
                Select "Options for Target" -> "Utilities".
                Press "Settings" button to see flashing algorithms.
                Verify that "nRF51xxx" is in the list of flashing algorithms, if not add it by pressing the "Add" button.
                Exit and save settings by pressing "OK". This is also important to do if you did find the "nRF51xxx" in the list of flashing algorithms.

    - If you have an existing KEIL project target set to use device variant "nRF51", a pop-up might appear stating that you have to "update your device selection".
        Solution:
            Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
            Select "Options for Target" -> "Device".
            Choose "Nordic nRF51 Series Devices" from the Database list.
            Select the variant of the nRF51 chip that is used for the KEIL project target.
    - When using J-Link software prior to version 4.66, a warning might appear when entering "Options for Target" -> "Debug" -> "Settings". The warning indicates that the device is unknown to the specific version of the J-Link software.
        Solution: Upgrade J-Link software to version 4.66 or later.
    - Segger J-Link software has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines, J-Link CDC installer fails producing an error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
        Solution: Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - NRFFOETT-205 - The nRF51822 installer will not run if no C:\ drive exists
    - NRFFOSDK-236 - When the bundled J-Link OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, the error message "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)" might appear . Ignore it. 
    - NRFFOSDK-362 - Reset button won't work after programming without cycling the target power.
    - NRFFOSDK-363 - Flashing software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode 
        Solution: Wake-up the current application from SYSTEM_OFF before flashing a new application.
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 11.25 ms. 
      This application will not be able to handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system reset in the middle of a firmware update. 
      Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during firmware update process, consider increasing the connection interval used by the master.

    ANT
        - NRFFOSDK-366 - ANT-FS host: download sometimes fails when downloading a large file. 
        - NRFFOSDK-755 - HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time. 

    BLE
        - NRFFOSDK-119 - Only the "....\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\nrf6310\ble\ble_app_pwr_profiling\","....\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_proximity\ ", and "....\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_hrs\ " applications are power optimized.
        - S120 Examples: Flash clear operation may fail when connected. Impact of this in the S120 examples is that if peer loses the bond and a re-bonding occurs, flash clear fails, and DM_EVT_DEVICE_CONTEXT_STORED event is notified with a failure.
        - Device manager has a few APIs unimplemented. Also documentation providing examples of how API can be used is missing.
        - NRFFOSDK-2824: Device manager (pstorage) doesn't support update of bond split across two pages.
        
    Proprietary:
        - NRFFOSDK-1769: Not all examples have makefiles, nor have they been tested with the new toolchain. Expect minor compilation issues.
        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.  
            
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

    Proprietary:
        - NRFFOSDK-1769: Not all examples have makefiles, nor have they been tested with the new toolchain. Expect minor compilation issues.
        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.  
            
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

Known issues:

    - Creating a blank project with Keil V5.0  it is not possible to choose the nRF51 series.
        Solution:
            Start new projects by making a copy of any existing keil project from the SDK

    - If you have an existing KEIL project target set to use device variant "nRF51", a pop-up might appear stating that you have to "update your device selection".
        Solution:
            Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
            Select "Options for Target" -> "Device".
            Choose "Nordic nRF51 Series Devices" from the Database list.
            Select the variant of the nRF51 chip that is used for the KEIL project target.

    - When using J-Link software prior to version 4.66, a warning might appear when entering "Options for Target" -> "Debug" -> "Settings". The warning indicates that the device is unknown to the specific version of the J-Link software.
        Solution: Upgrade J-Link software to version 4.66 or later.
    - Segger J-Link software has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines, J-Link CDC installer fails producing an error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
        Solution: Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - NRFFOETT-205 - The nRF51822 installer will not run if no C:\ drive exists

            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.  
            
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).



nRF51 SDK v. 4.4.0
------------------

Following toolchains/devices have been used for testing and verification:
    - ARM: MDK-ARM Version 4.71.2
	- GCC: gcc-arm-embedded 4.7 2013q1
    - N51422 QFAACA on PCA10003 evaluation kit board
    - N51822 QFAACA on PCA10004/5 module on nRF6310 motherboard
    - Windows XP SP3 32 bit
    - Windows 7 SP1 64 bit
    - BLE SoftDevice Version : s110_nrf51822_5.2.1 
    - The BLE example applications for HID Keyboard and HID Mouse have been tested with HID host running on Windows 8.

Changes:

    - Device Firmware Update example released as part of the main SDK.
      - Added support for image transfer over BLE.
      - HCI Transport Layer used for serial transfer.
      - Note: This example is implemented to work on nRF6310 motherboard because it uses Button 7 to enter bootloader mode on reset. 
	      This is because Button 0 and Button 1 are used by other SDK applications as wakeup buttons.
	      If this example is to be changed to work for evaluation kit board, then this should be taken into consideration.
      - PC application examples for performing firmware updates using HCI and BLE added in nrf6310\device_firmware_updates\experimental folder.

    - UICR Configuration example added to the SDK. It can be found in nrf6310\uicr_config_example folder.

    ANT
	 None 
            
    BLE
       - NRFFOETT-507: ble_app_dtm missing bytes on UART fixed.
       - NRFFOSDK-73 : HID keyboard application will now send one key press per notification. 
   

    Proprietary

Fixed issues:

    ANT
	 None 

    BLE
	- NRFFOSDK-1432: Buffer overflow issue in ble_bondmngr_sys_attr_store() function fixed.
	- NRFFOETT-339: CCCD values (System Atributes) are now restored on reconnection to a known master only after the link is encrypted.

    Proprietary
	 None

Known issues:
   
     - If you have an existing KEIL project target set to use device variant "nRF51", a pop-up might appear stating that you have to "update your device selection".
        Solution:
            Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
            Select "Options for Target" -> "Device".
            Choose "Nordic nRF51 Series Devices" from the Database list.
            Select the variant of the nRF51 chip that is used for the KEIL project target.

    - When using J-Link software prior to version 4.66, a warning might appear when entering "Options for Target" -> "Debug" -> "Settings". The warning indicates that the device is unknown to the specific version of the J-Link software.
        Solution: Upgrade J-Link software to version 4.66 or later.

    - Segger J-Link software has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines, J-Link CDC installer fails producing an error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
        Solution: Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - NRFFOETT-205 - The nRF51822 installer will not run if no C:\ drive exists
    - NRFFOSDK-236 - When the bundled J-Link OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, the error message "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)" might appear . Ignore it. 
    - NRFFOSDK-362 - Reset button won't work after programming without cycling the target power.
    - NRFFOSDK-363 - Flashing software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode 
        Solution: Wake-up the current application from SYSTEM_OFF before flashing a new application.
    - NRFFOSDK-1774: During SDK installation, chosing custom install location for SDK examples will create Start Menu shortcuts that point to Keil installation location.
    - NRFFOSDK-1592: There is a risk of losing timer interrupts when the resolution of the timer is very high, e.g. 1 ms resolution. 
    - The DFU over BLE example has been tested to work with a minimum connection interval of 11.25 ms. 
      This application will not be able to handle connection intervals lower than 11.25 ms and may undergo a system reset in the middle of a firware update. 
      Workaround: If you face unexpected disconnects during firmware update process, consider increasing the connection interval used by the master.
	
  
    ANT
	- NRFFOETT-438 - Documentation on S210 SoftDevice API wrongly structured. All SoftDevice functions appear as SVCALL in the Doxygen page.
        - NRFFOSDK-366 - ANT-FS host: download sometimes fails when downloading a large file. 
        - NRFFOSDK-755 - HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time. 
      
    BLE
	- NRFFOETT-399 - The bond manager will use distrubted IRK in its whitelist regardless of the type of central's address and should actually use the irk if distributed and if the central's address is not public, and not random_static and not random_private_non_resovable. 
        - NRFFOSDK-119 - Only the "....\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\nrf6310\ble\ble_app_pwr_profiling\","....\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_proximity\ ", and "....\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_hrs\ " applications are power optimized.
        - NRFFOSDK-472 - Bonding information in flash are not erased during programming of a new application.
            (If the bonding information is not erased manually - by pressing button 1 during start-up - the new application might assert. )
       
    Proprietary:
	- NRFFOSDK-1769: Not all examples have makefiles, nor have they been tested with the new toolchain. Expect minor compilation issues.
        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.  
            
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).


nRF51 SDK v. 4.3.0
------------------

Following toolchains/devices have been used for testing and verification:
    - ARM: MDK-ARM Version 4.60
	- GCC: gcc-arm-embedded 4.7 2013q1
    - N51422 QFAACA on PCA10003 evaluation kit board

    - Windows XP SP3 32 bit
    - Windows 7 SP1 64 bit
    - BLE SoftDevice Version : s110_nrf51822_5.2.0

Changes:

    - Supported GCC toolchain switched from CodeSourcery to gcc-arm-embedded.
        - New gcc startup file, linker scripts, and makefiles.
        - Updated CMSIS header files in Include/gcc to the latest revision (3.20).
        - Makefile target "all" now runs "clean" and "debug" targets instead of incremental "release" target.
    - nrf.h requires projects to have a define for a chip to enable some needed workarounds.
	- SDK examples now support PCA10000 v2.0.0. To make the examples work on the older PCA10000 v1.0, the UART pins need to be remapped in the pca10000.h header file.
		For v1.0
			#define RX_PIN_NUMBER  3
			#define TX_PIN_NUMBER  1
			#define CTS_PIN_NUMBER 2
			#define RTS_PIN_NUMBER 0
		For v2.0.0
			#define RX_PIN_NUMBER  11
			#define TX_PIN_NUMBER  9
			#define CTS_PIN_NUMBER 10
			#define RTS_PIN_NUMBER 8
    
    ANT
            - ANT examples have been updated to support the newest UART API.
    BLE
	    - HCI Transport Layer from Bluetooth Specification v4.0 introduced for BLE S110 Serialized Applications. 
		- BLE S110 Serialization Examples released as part of the main SDK.
		- Updated serialized ble_app_advertising and ble_app_hrs to use app_scheduler.
	    - Connection Parameter update module : Added possibility to request different connection parameters multiple times. A new event, BLE_CONN_PARAMS_EVT_SUCCEEDED has been created. Event handler implementation needs to take this into account, especially if they were implemented to trigger a disconnect regardless of the type of event.
		- Added Makefile and Eclipse project file for ble_app_hrs.
		- Changed hard coded flash pages to be FICR CODESIZE dependent.
           
    Proprietary
        - Gazell:
			- Added Gazell Pairing Host source code and board example. Backwards compatible with nRF24L Gazell Pairing Device and Host modules.
			- Added function nrf_gzll_set_auto_disable(uint32_t num_ticks), to disable Gazell after a number of timeslots.
			- Added function nrf_gzll_get_tick_count().
			- Gazell Pairing Device now uses nrf_gzll_get_tick_count() in order to implement a delay. This reduces current consumption.
			- Default sync_lifetime value has been increased to 3*channel_table_size*number_of_timeslots_per_channel. This improves performance in high-interference environments. Current users who are satisfied with the performance may wish to maintain the minimum value of 1*channel_table_size*number_of_timeslots_per_channel, in order to avoid any slight increase in current consumption.
        - Enhanced ShockBurst:
			- ESB PTX now calls nrf_esb_tx_success() callback instead of nrf_esb_tx_failed() for NOACK packets.
			- Fix in nrf_esb_set_mode() 
        - Information concerning backwards compatibility with nRF24L devices has been moved to the User Guide.
		
Fixed issues:

    - Examples doing flash writes were not waiting for writes to finish.
    
    ANT
	    - NRFFOSDK-1312 - Changed ANTFS_TRANSMIT_POWER define in antfs.h from 0 to 3. The define previously had an incorrect definition which set the power value to -20dBm instead of 0dBm even though the comment indicated 0dBm. 

    BLE
	    - NRFFOETT-402 - DFU Bootloader application in experimental project now sets stack pointer correctly before executing reset vector of application.

    Proprietary
	    - NRFFOETT-301 - Radio example uses obsolete RADIO_TXPOWER_TXPOWER_Neg40dBm definition.
        - Fixed issue in TWI HW driver. Event was not cleared before waiting it to get cleared.
        - Floating point ABI used by Makefiles was incorrect. Now using mabi-float=soft.
        - Gazell/ESB: Fixed set_mode() functionality.
        - Gazell GCC board examples startup and run correctly with the GCC libraries.
        - A Gazell Device nows stop the RSSI measurement when no ACK is received, improving the base current consumption.

Known issues:
    - If you have an existing KEIL project target set to use device variant "nRF51", a pop-up might appear stating that you have to "update your device selection".
        Solution:
            Press ALT+F7 to open "Options for Target" dialog.
            Select "Options for Target" -> "Device".
            Choose "Nordic nRF51 Series Devices" from the Database list.
            Select the variant of the nRF51 chip that is used for the KEIL project target.


    - When using J-Link software prior to version 4.66, a warning might appear when entering "Options for Target" -> "Debug" -> "Settings". The warning indicates that the device is unknown to the specific version of the J-Link software.
        Solution: Upgrade J-Link software to version 4.66 or later.

    - Segger J-Link software has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines, J-Link CDC installer fails producing an error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
        Solution: Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - NRFFOETT-205 - The nRF51822 installer will not run if no C:\ drive exists
    - NRFFOSDK-236 - When the bundled J-Link OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, the error message "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)" might appear . Ignore it. 
    - NRFFOSDK-362 - Reset button won't work after programming without cycling the target power.
    - NRFFOSDK-363 - Flashing software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode 
        Solution: Wake-up the current application from SYTEM_OFF before flashing a new application.
 
    ANT
        - NRFFOSDK-366 - ANT-FS host: download sometimes fails when downloading a large file. 
        - NRFFOSDK-755 - HRM TX buttons example may report wrong total elapsed time. 
      
    BLE
        - NRFFOSDK-119 - Only the "....\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\nrf6310\ble\ble_app_pwr_profiling\","....\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_proximity\ ", and "....\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_hrs\ " applications are power optimized.
        - NRFFOSDK-472 - Bonding information in flash are not erased during programming of a new application.
            (If the bonding information is not erased manually - by pressing button 1 during start-up - the new application might assert. )

        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.
        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
            - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
            - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
            - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.
            The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the nRF51 examples:
                hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
                hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
                hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);
            In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the payloads received in ACK.  
            
        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).

Changes:

    Bluetooth:
        - Adapted examples for updated S110 API (S110_nRF51822_2.0.0_alpha1).
        - Added Find Me (Immediate Alert Service as client) to Proximity Application.
        - Added Alert Notification (client) service and example.
        - Added Cycling Speed and Cadence service and example.
        - Added Running Speed and Cadence service and example.
        - Bond Manager modified to add Whitelist handling and CRC verification of flash.
        - Bond Manager usage added to all examples except for power profiling application.
        - Use of Whitelist added to Proximity, HID Mouse and HID Keyboard examples.
        - Use of directed advertisement added to HID Mouse and HID Keyboard examples.
        - Timer Module refactored.

    Proprietary:
        - Added nRF24L series address conversion functions to radio_example.
        - Added support for GCC to nRF51 Code Examples, ESB and Gazell examples.
        - Examples no longer use deprecated PERPOWER register.
        - Disabled "Download to flash" and "Verify Code Download" in JLink debug Download Options.
        - All SDK release notes are now in this file.
        - Added hardware flow control option to simple_uart. 
        - Fixed compilation problems with Keil ARM MDK v4.60 and ram retention, temperature and blinky examples.
        - debouncer_example, ppi_example and timer_example now explicitly set timer bitmode.
        - keil_arm_uv4.lnt include folder changed from C:\Keil\ARM\RV31\INC to C:\Keil\ARM\ARMCC\INC.
        - Corrected location of SFR files in UV projects.

        - ESB: ESB PRX transceiver operations are shorted, removing continuous wave transmission and improving speed and current consumption. 
        - ESB: PRX starts listening immediately after sending an ACK, no longer waiting for the next timeslot.
        - ESB: The NOACK bit is changed to an ACK bit to ensure compatibility with L01 radios. The L01 product specification is incorrect, only devices using dynamic ack will see this. 
        - ESB: esb_is_enabled function added.
        - ESB: Disabling CRC checking on PRX/Host side works correctly
        - ESB: Added support for controlling the XOSC outside the ESB library

        - Gazell: Added support for controlling the XOSC outside the Gazell library
        - GZP: No longer deletes pairing data on gzp_init. Added functions to check if device has pairing data and delete all pairing info from flash. 
        - GZP: gzp_desktop_emulator example requires only one key press to pair and has been tested to work on SoftDevice.
        - GZP: nrf_nvmc_write_bytes correctly iterates through bytes.

Fixed issues:
    - Examples use deprecated PERPOWER register. 

    Proprietary:
        - When using Keil ARM MDK v4.60 the ram retention, temperature and blinky examples might fail during compilation.
        - Gazell and ESB examples point to wrong SFR file (should be SFD\Nordic\nRF51\nRF51822.sfr). 

    Bluetooth:
          - The buttons on the evaluation board are not debounced.

Known issues:
    - Segger JLink has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
    - On some Windows XP machines JLink CDC installer fails with error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi. 
      Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
    - When the bundled JLink OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, it might pop up an error saying "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)". Ignore it. (DRGN-1807)
    - Reset button wont work after programing without cycling the target power. (DRGN-1885)
    - Flashing a software using SEGGER is possible only when NOT in SYSTEM_OFF mode (implies to wake-up the current application with a button press for example before flashing a new application).(DRGN-1925)
      
    Bluetooth:
        - Only the .\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\nrf6310\ble\ble_app_pwr_profiling\ and ....\Nordic\nrf51822\Board\pca10001\ble\ble_app_hrs\  applications are power optimized.(DRGN-1914)
        - ble_bondmngr_store_bonded_masters function from the bond manager cannot be used when advertising nor when in a connection (DRGN-1915)
         (flash erase/write prevents the CPU from running which means the stack will not be able to run properly.) 
          If ble_bondmngr_store_bonded_masters function is called while advertising or in a connection, the behavior is UNDEFINED.

    Proprietary:
        - ESB/Gazell: Calling nrf_esb_init() or nrf_gzll_init() will disable usage of the GPIOTE peripheral. In order to use the GPIOTE peripheral, the workaround in PAN 22 must be performed after calling these functions.         
        - Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
        - Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in PAN_028 and will be fixed in future silicon.

        - The nRF24Lxx ESB examples found in the legacy nRFready
          SDKs do not work out of the box with the nRF51 ESB examples. This is due to:
        - The legacy examples do not use "payload in ACK".
        - The legacy examples use RF channel 2 (not 10 as the nRF51 examples).
        - The examples do not use dynamic payload length.

          The legacy examples need to add the following in order to work with the
          nRF51 examples:

          hal_nrf_setup_dynamic_payload(0xFF);
          hal_nrf_enable_dynamic_payload(true);
          hal_nrf_enable_ack_payload(true);
          hal_nrf_set_rf_channel(10);

          In addition, the legacy PTX example must add code for handling the
          payloads received in ACK.  

        - The Gazell Link Layer examples are not fully "out of the box" compatible 
          with the legacy Gazell examples provided in the nRFgo SDK for nRF24Lxx
          devices. The timeslot periods and channel tables require adjustment.
        - Timeslot period: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects,
          or use the nrf_gzll_set_timeslot_period() function in the nRF51 projects
          (nRF51 Gazell timeslot period = 0.5*GZLL_RX_PERIOD).
        - Channel table: Edit gzll_params.h file used in the nRF24Lxx projects, 
          or use the nrf_gzll_set_channel_table() function in the nRF51 projects.
        - Gazell does not support "Low Power Host mode" (Host mode 1).







nRF518 SDK v1.1.1
-----------------

Changes:
- Master Control Panel updated to version 3.1.1. Includes fix for issue where pca10000 master emulator devices did not get detected.

Known issues:
- When the bundled JLink OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, it might pop up an error saying "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)". Ignore it.
- When using Keil ARM MDK v4.60 the ram retention, temperature and blinky examples might fail during compilation and leave an error message like this:
    C3900U: Unrecognized option '--asm'.
    C3900U: Unrecognized option '--interleave'.
  To fix this Click Alt+F7, choose Listing tab. Uncheck C Compiler Listing 
- Previous issues from v1.1.0 does still apply







nRF518 SDK v1.1.0
-----------------

Following toolchains/devices have been used for testing and verification:
- ARM: MDK-ARM Version 4.54
- N51822 QFAACA on PCA10004 module on nRF6310 motherboard
- N51822 QFAACA on PCA10000 USB dongle
- N51822 QFAACA on PCA10001 board
- Windows XP SP3 32-bit
- Windows 7 SP1 64-bit

Known issues:
- Examples use depracated PERPOWER register. Future silicon will power up peripherals after reset and PERPOWER register will be removed.
- Using Keil versions 4.53 and older will not work unless you change configuration in jlinksettings.ini. See User Guide for more details.
- Temperature example does not give sane output values. This is hardware related issue described in
- Segger JLink has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.

- Gazell and ESB examples point to wrong SFR file (should be SFD\Nordic\nRF51\nRF51822.sfr). 
- Reset button wont work after programing without cycling the target power. Workaround is to update system_nrf51.c with 
  void SystemInit (void) 
  {
      /* Switch ON both RAM banks */
      NRF_POWER->RESET = POWER_RESET_RESET_Enabled;
      NRF_POWER->RAMON |= (POWER_RAMON_ONRAM0_RAM0On << POWER_RAMON_ONRAM0_Pos) |
                          (POWER_RAMON_ONRAM1_RAM1On << POWER_RAMON_ONRAM1_Pos);
  } 

Bluetooth:
  - The button on the evaluation board are not debounced in hardware and the application implementing for it does not debounce the button presses either (using software mechanisms). So there will be additional increments/decrements of heart rate measurement while pressing the buttons.

------------------

Following toolchains/devices have been used for testing and verification:
- ARM: MDK-ARM Version 4.60
- N51422 QFAACA on PCA10004 module on nRF6310 motherboard
- N51422 QFAACA on PCA10006 module on nRF6310 motherboard
- N51822 QFAACA on nRF2752 module on nRF6310 motherboard
- N51822 QFAACA on PCA10001 evaluation kit board
- Windows XP SP3 32-bit
- Windows 7 SP1 64-bit

Changes:
- Added Bicycle Power minimal slave example.
- Added Stride and Distance Monitor minimal slave and master example.
- Removed deprecated PERPOWER register from examples and header files.

Known issues:
- Segger JLink has some issues with Keil. See http://www.segger.com/IDE_Integration_Keil.html#knownproblems for more details.
- On some Windows XP machines JLink CDC installer fails with error message saying it could not find JLinkCDCDriver_x86.msi.
  - Try running the installer C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLinkARM_V<version>\USBDriver\JLinkCDCInstaller_V1.2b.exe manually.
- When the bundled JLink OB CDC driver installation dialog appears, it might pop up an error saying "Failed to install driver (Timeout occurred)". Ignore it.
- Flashing a software using SEGGER is NOT possible when the device is in SYSTEM_OFF mode (implies to wake-up the current application from SYTEM_OFF before flashing a new application)
- Reset button won't work after programming with Keil without cycling the target power. On the other hand if nrfjprog with -p (pin reset) is used to program the device, reset button will work.
- Using -p option in nrfjprog too heavily might block JLink. This block can be resolved by re-cycling the JLink power.


nRF514 SDK v1.1.0
-----------------

Following toolchains/devices have been used for testing and verification:
- ARM: MDK-ARM Version 4.54
- N51422 QFAACA on PCA10001 module
- N51422 QFAACA on a PCA10005 modulea on nRF6310 motherboard

Known issues:
- When having an application which starts up by putting the chip in SystemOff mode, and wakeup source is not configured correctly, the device cannot be programmed.
  Workaround: Use nrfjprog with "recover" option to wipe the application keeping the application in SystemOff mode.
- For PCA10003 examples using UART, the terminal program on the PC has to release the COM port when PCA10003 is power cycled. It is not possible for the PCA10003 to keep a connection up when performing a power cycle.
  Workaround: Close terminal program for each time you want to perform a power recycle

Changes:
- Added examples for PCA10003 Evaluation kit.
- Added nrfjprog.exe - Nordic Semiconductor command line nRF51 programming tool using JLink dll's.
- Added custom system_nrf51422.c in templates folder for handling reset after flashing and turning all peripherals on (except GPIOTE) as described in PAN028.
- Removed references to depricated PERPOWER register in ANT code examples.
- Added compiler flag to the ANT examples, to easier being able to run examples without any UART.
- Modified simple_uart_config() parameters. Added new parameters for flow control
- Added include/boards folder for handling examples targeted for different boards
- Fixed bug in timer_example
- Fixed bug in spi_example
