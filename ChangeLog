            Fix bug in basicVarEquals for big strings
            More fixes for low memory conditions
            Multi-line edit for commands (but no newline or line delete yet)
            Handle Home, End + reverse delete keys
            Fix nested for loops not handling interrupts correctly
            Fix AppendString issue when given start value greater than string
            Add 'changeInterval' to allow things created with setInterval to have the frequency changed (eg. stepper motor control)
            Now puts itself to sleep to save power, when it knows nothing is required and it'll be woken up by SysTick before
            Change Math library to avoid putting constants in RAM

     1v10 : Increase FIFO size for VL
            Marginally decrease amount of F4 vars to ensure they all fit in one flash sector
            Allow strings to be longer than the max token size
            '"key" in obj' syntax
            Detect if in FOR or WHILE loop, and if not, disallow break and continue
            Change min setInterval time to 0.1ms - F4 can get close to this
            Better analog pin error message
            USB support on Olimexino/Maple
            Start of multiple COM port support (ioEvent queue)
            Ctrl-C now clears the input line
            Save state of 'echo' into flash with save()
            Add 'setBusyIndicator(pin)' to set pin high when Espruino is busy
            Inbuilt function handling speed improvements
            Allow Serial comms via other UARTS. Serial1/2.onData and print/println
            now inserts elements into arrays in the correct order (GetLength can be (is) now much faster)
            Faster code to work out pins from strings
            Automatically convert IDs in form A#,A##,B#,B## etc into numbers.
            Built-in constants for LED1/BTN/etc.

     1v09 : Enabled 'abs' by default
            Added flash programming to STM32F4
            analogWrite now working!

     1v08 : Add preliminary STM32F4 support
            Allowed test cases to test timers - eg. code in jsinteractive.c
            Fix memory leak for timer
            Fix memory leak for digitalWrite

     1v07 : Fix string charAt
            Fix watch on different pin
            Pass arguments to event handlers - eg. time
            digitalWrite/Read to take arrays of pins, and int for value

     1v06 : Add break + continue
            Add switch statement
            Handle /r, /r/n or just /n for newlines - phone compatible
            Handle different type of delete

     1v05 : Allow setWatch/setTimeout/setInterval with a string
            Handle adding Open bracket then deleting it
            When calling a NAMED function, zero the scopes - this stops scope table overflow

     1v04 : Renamed to Espruino
            Fixed issue with event add when out of memory
            If out of memory happens during a timer, kill all timers
